## About
My aim for this project was to implement the smtplib module in Python. I wanted to learn how this module works while also putting it to good use. 
My girlfriend loves dogs & cows - so to start her day off right, the code will email her a cute dog or cow picture every morning! 

The script is scheduled to run locally on a cron job every morning:

`crontab -e`
